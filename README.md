I’m excited to present my graduation project at Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative - DEPI powered by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT), Egypt ,the Defects Analysis Report, which was a deep dive into optimizing production processes by analyzing defect trends across materials, vendors, and plant locations. Despite the challenges, this project was completed in under three days—a timeframe much shorter than originally planned—so it was rushed, but the results are still comprehensive. I was able to identify key issues such as high defect rates in raw materials and films, as well as significant downtime caused by vendors like Solholdings and Dentocity. The recommendations include addressing these inefficiencies, improving vendor quality control, and conducting operational audits at plants like Detroit and Springfield to boost productivity.
While the time constraints made it a more intense experience, I’m proud of the insights gained, which could help lead to more efficient manufacturing processes and improved vendor management.
